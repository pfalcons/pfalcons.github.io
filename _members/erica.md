"Justin and Erica are now married despite riding with our team for two years. If the relationship can withstand this shit, itâ€™s solid. Justin and Erica are now an integral part of, and actually the future of, the Perineum Falcons. When not challenging teammates to a drunken race down the streets or canals of some town late at night, they can occasionally be found kicking ass on a bike." - Captain Mike James
