"My wife Jenny had known him from living in the dorms at Iowa. We happened upon him in complete exhaustion in some in-between town on Ragbrai in 2006. He was riding an unnecessarily heavy bike, as he tends to do, and pulling like 75# on a Bob trailer. After talking to him, we ascertained that he was waiting for the post office to open so he could ship all his gear back home. It was just too much weight to handle. You should have seen the look of sheer desperation on his face when we told him it was Sunday. His head in his hands, we told him that he was with us now. We rented a crane to get his trailer on top of the bus and he’s been with us ever since." - Captain Mike James
