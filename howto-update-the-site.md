Let me guess, was the RAGBRAI route was just announced? It is too cold outside to hang out in spandex but you are just itching to show your excitement in some way. Hey, just a thought... Update the website!

Most content is pretty straightforward once you get into the backend at forestry.io, but there is some site content that was just too custom for forestry to handle: RAGBRAI/RAGBRAI Data. Let's walk through it.

Scour the RAGBRAI.com website for the logo and save it to the site via Media.

First head into RAGBRAI Data and find the upcoming year you want to update. Hopefully the data file has a few blank entries for years to come, otherwise you will have to find a non-forestry way (GitHub) of adding a year to the file. Enter all the details that the RAGBRAI announcement party gave you for now. This new data won't show anywhere however unless you create a RAGBRAI "page" with the same name (e.g. 2006).

**_Psst. Keep this file as a draft so it doesn't go "public" for the whole world to read._**
