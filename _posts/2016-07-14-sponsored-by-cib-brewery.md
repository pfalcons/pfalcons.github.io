The Perineum Falcons are excited to announce that [CIB Brewery](http://cibbrewery.com/), out of Carson, IA will be our sponsor for RAGBRAI XLIV. Known as a farmhouse nano-brewery, this small operation arguably produces some of the best beer in the state of Iowa.

We first spotted this beer a few years back at Millstream Brewing's "Festival of Iowa Beers." You could find us in line for another pour all afternoon. Near Iowa City, we have also enjoyed them at the Iowa City Oktoberfest and Short's Burger and Shine. In this writer's opinion, a favorite is the Cheri Tart, which originally was a lambic that contained local cherries. I think this has been switched to a sour ale due to the cherry supply, but is still a real treat.

CIB Brewery will be supplying the team with their beer, so come out and find us along the route for a sample! You are also welcome to stop by their BBQ taproom in Carson, IA as well.
