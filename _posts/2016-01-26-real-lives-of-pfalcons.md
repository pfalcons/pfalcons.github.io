If you were there and sober enough to remember, we came up with jobs we thought some of our team members might do in their real lives. Here is a list of what we came up with.

* Petey – Iowa police desk sergeant - he just has the mustache for it.
* Lois – Mason City bus tour guide
* Amanda – Angry DMV clerk
* Joe – Central Iowa Grassland Museum curator
* Erica – Angry librarian
* Justin – Mute balloon animal artist
* Annie – Former crossing guard turned crack addict post traumatic work accident (bees caused her to wrongly direct traffic into some children.)
* Chris WZ – Pro basketball player turned porn star
* Fro – Jr. Assistant Manager at Radio Shack by day, glory hole attendant at 7-11 by night
* Jenny- Fresh out of high school porn star specializing in lactation fetishes.
* Mike – Porn producer
* Wanker – Drummer that plays in an "Animal"-from the Muppets costume
* Kathy – Dominatrix
* Chai – Freelance Gardener/Landscaper working out of the Home Depot parking lot

We have some "where are they now" updates:

* Chai - While walking into Home Depot to pick up supplies, there was an ICE raid on undocumented workers. He got swept up with them and was deported to Mexico where he sells Chiclets on the side of the road.
* Lois - Wouldn't you know it, tollbooth operators are some of the friendliest people on the planet. Lois made an easy and natural transition to this career spending generous amounts of time getting to know each and every person in every vehicle that comes to her booth doling out advice on local attractions and eateries as well as very detailed directions to get there. Of course because she is so good at her job, she naturally has the longest line of visitors.
* Joe - A busy year, as he added big blue stem to his collection of grasses.
* Jenny - starred in Mad Max: Fury Road as a milk mother. look it up. I was going to send a picture, but I can't be putting that kind of thing in your work email inbox.
* Don - gourmet beer and breast milk cheese maker in business with Petey at "Don and Petey's Beer, Wine and Cheese Emporium". Jenny and Erica provide breast milk for specialty cheeses. Erica's is nutty, Jenny's is spicy.
* Erica - as an angry librarian, was the inspiration for "Roz" on Monsters Inc. She also jello wrestles Annie at bachelor parties.
* Chris WZ - Following his naked parade route sign display last year on Ragbrai, Chris realized his calling as a nude sandwich board advertiser on the streets of Houston.
* Brandon - works as a smile model for Colgate and is Captain of the Colgate Cavity Patrol. Also happily teaches line dancing to firefighting crews as a fundraising activity.
* Fro - has moved on to bigger and better glory holes in the San Francisco area.

I look forward to the team's effort in beating last year's record for spontaneous wrestling matches.
