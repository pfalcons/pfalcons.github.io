Consider this a relaunch, a fresh start, something special.

A couple of things to note:
- The URLs perineumfalcons.com and pfalcons.com both get you here.
- Unless it was on someone's computer at home or in the flickr pool, we lost everything during the last server shutdown. Lessons we learned:
- Pay the bill.
- Backup periodically.
- Twitter [@pfalcons](https://twitter.com/pfalcons) doesn't cost money or run on the same server as the website, so check there in the future if the site goes down.
- I now develop websites for a living so give me a hard time if something isn't right. I have all the time in the world to work on it.

That is all for right now.
